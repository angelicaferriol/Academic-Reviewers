    "# Unit 2 - Introduction to Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Donald Knuth**  \n",
    "A person well-trained in computer science knows how to deal with algorithms: how to construct, manipulate, analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm  \n",
    "A sequence of unambiguous steps for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time.  \n",
    "Not a solution but a finite precise procedure to get to the solution.  \n",
    "Can be specified in natural language or pseudocode, which can also be implemented as computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Characteristics  \n",
    "- The non-ambiguity requirement for each step of an algorithm cannot be compromised.  \n",
    "- The range of inputs for which an algorithm works has to be specified carefully.  \n",
    "- The same algorithm can be represented in several different ways.  \n",
    "- There may exist several algorithms for solving the same problem.  \n",
    "- Algorithms for the same problem can be based on very different ideas and can solve the problem at dramatically different speeds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithms for a problem must…**  \n",
    "- Work perfectly for all legitimate inputs.  \n",
    "- Work not for most of the time but all the time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Among several ways to classify algorithms, the two principal alternatives are…**  \n",
    "- By the types of problems they solve.  \n",
    "- By underlying design techniques they are based upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Design Techniques  \n",
    "Also known as algorithm design strategies or paradigms  \n",
    "General approaches to solving problems algorithmically that apply to various problems from different computing areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem.  \n",
    "- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.  \n",
    "- In computing, algorithms provide computers with a successive guide to completing actions  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do Computer Algorithms Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer algorithms work via input and output. They take the input and apply each step of the algorithm to that information to generate an output.  \n",
    "- For example, a search engine is an algorithm that takes a search query as an input and searches its database for items relevant to the words in the query. It then outputs the results  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Problem Solving  \n",
    "### 1. Understanding the Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before designing an algorithm, you need to understand completely the problem given.  \n",
    "- Read the problem’s description and ask questions if you have any doubts about the problem.  \n",
    "- Do some examples and think about special cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ascertaining the Capabilities of a Computational Device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you completely understand, you need to ascertain the capabilities of the computational device the algorithm is intended for.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Choosing Between Exact and Approximate Problem Solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next decision is to chose between solving the problem exactly or solving the problem approximately.  \n",
    "  - **Exact Algorithm**: solve the problem exactly.  \n",
    "  - **Approximate Algorithm**: Solve the problem approximately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Deciding on Appropriate Data Structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some algorithms do not demand any ingenuity in representing their inputs. But others are predicated on ingenious data structures.  \n",
    "- Algorithm + Data Structure = Program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Algorithm Design Techniques. (Strategy/Paradigm)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Methods of Specifying an Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pseudocode** is a mixture of natural language and programming language-like constructs. It is usually more precise than a natural language and its usage often yields more succinct algorithm descriptions.  \n",
    "- **Flowchart** is a method of expressing an algorithm by a collection of connected geometric shapes containing descriptions of the algorithm’s steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Proving an Algorithm’s Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to prove that the algorithm yields a required result of every legitimate input in a finite amount of time. A common technique for proving correctness is to use mathematical induction because an algorithm’s iterations provide a natural sequence of steps needed for such proofs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Analyzing an Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Efficiency** indicates how fast the algorithm runs.  \n",
    "- **Space Efficiency** indicates how much extra memory the algorithm needs. Other desirable characteristics of an algorithm are simplicity and generality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Coding an Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting your algorithm into a language it understands by your computer/machine.  \n",
    "- Programming an algorithm presents both a peril and an opportunity. The peril lies in the possibility of making the transition from an algorithm to a program either incorrectly or very inefficiently.  \n",
    "- Validity of the program is still established by testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria of a Good Algorithm\n",
