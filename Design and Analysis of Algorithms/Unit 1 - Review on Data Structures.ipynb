    "\n",
    "## Data  \n",
    "Refers to any collection of information, facts, or statistics that can be stored, organized, and analyzed for various purposes.  \n",
    "**Mnemonic:** D → I → K → W  \n",
    "Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom  \n",
    "**Examples:** weights, prices and costs, numbers of items sold, employee names, product names\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures  \n",
    "A particular scheme of organizing related data items.  \n",
    "Provide the means to organize, store, and manipulate data efficiently.\n",
    "A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.  \n",
    "A particular scheme of organizing related data items.  \n",
    "A collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Structures  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitive Data Structures  \n",
    "Basic structures provided by the programming language itself, with a fixed memory representation.  \n",
    "They may be immutable or mutable depending on the programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Primitive Data Structures  \n",
    "Complex structures using primitive data types as building blocks.  \n",
    "They require dynamic memory allocation and have variable memory representation.  \n",
    "Typically mutable and can be modified during execution.  \n",
    "**Common Operations:** Traversing, adding/removing elements, and searching for specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Data Structures  \n",
    "Data elements are arranged in a sequential order.  \n",
    "Each element has a unique predecessor and successor, except for the first and last elements, which may have only one adjacent element.  \n",
    "Typically one-dimensional, with elements connected in a linear fashion.  \n",
    "With the increase in the size of the data structure, the time complexity of the structure increases.  \n",
    "**Common Linear Data Structures:** Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Linear Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Array  \n",
    "Sequence of items stored contiguously in memory, allowing constant-time access via an index.  \n",
    "Store elements of the same data type or heterogeneous elements, depending on the programming language.  \n",
    "**Components:**  \n",
    "- Elements - Individual values stored within the array.  \n",
    "- Index - Position of an element.  \n",
    "- Size - Total number of elements the array can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linked List  \n",
    "Sequence of nodes, each containing data and links to other nodes.  \n",
    "**Components:**  \n",
    "- Head - Starting point.  \n",
    "- Tail - Last node pointing to NULL.  \n",
    "- Node - Basic building block containing data and link(s) to other nodes.  \n",
    "  - Data - the actual information being stored in the node.  \n",
    "  - Link - contains a single pointer or more pointers that contain points to other nodes.  \n",
    "**Types:**  \n",
    "- Singly Linked List - Two parts: data and address part.  \n",
    "- Doubly Linked List - Three parts: data and two address parts.  \n",
    "- Circular Linked List - Last node connects to the first.  \n",
    "- Doubly Circular Linked List - Features of both Doubly and Circular Linked List.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stack  \n",
    "Stack has one end, whereas it contains only one top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.  \n",
    "Follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.  \n",
    "**Real-Life Examples:** Piling of plates in one place, storing rice boxes in a storage, a deck of playing cards  \n",

    "## Examples & Case Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Stack in Browser History**  \n",
    "- A web browser uses a stack to manage visited pages.  \n",
    "- When a user visits a new page, it's pushed onto the stack.  \n",
    "- Pressing \"Back\" pops the most recent page, returning to the previous one.  \n",
    "- Pressing \"Forward\" pushes the next page if the user goes back and then navigates forward again\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Queue in CPU Scheduling**  \n",
    "- Operating systems use a queue to schedule processes.  \n",
    "- The ready queue follows FIFO, ensuring older processes execute first.  \n",
    "- Round-robin scheduling uses a queue where each process gets a time slice before moving to the back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Tree in File Systems**  \n",
    "- A computer file system is structured as a tree.  \n",
    "- The root directory contains multiple subdirectories (children).  \n",
    "- Each subdirectory can contain further subdirectories or files (leaf nodes).  \n",
    "- Searching for a file involves traversing the tree efficiently.\n",

    "- In what real-life situations would a queue be a better data structure choice than a stack? Explain with examples.  \n",
    "- How do the components of a tree (like root, leaf, ancestor, and degree) help in organizing and navigating hierarchical data?  \n",
