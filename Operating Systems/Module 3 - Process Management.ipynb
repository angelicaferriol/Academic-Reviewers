    "\n",
    "- A **process** is a **program in execution**.\n",
    "- A **program** is a **passive** entity (e.g., source code or binary file).\n",
    "- A **process** is an **active** entity (running instance of a program).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Writing a program in C/C++ → compiling creates binary code (program).\n",
    "- Running the binary file → becomes a **process**.\n",
    "- Running the same program multiple times = multiple processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "A process in memory is divided into four sections:\n",

    "# Lesson 3: Process Creation and Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic operations that can be performed on a process: Creation and Termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process may be created in the system for different operations. Some of the events that lead to process creation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User request for process creation  \n",
    "- System initialization  \n",
    "- Batch job initialization  \n",
    "- Execution of a process creation system call by a running process  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in Process Creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a new process is created, the operating system assigns a unique Process Identifier (PID) to it and inserts a new entry in primary process table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then the required memory space for all the elements of process such as program, data, and stack is allocated including space for its Process Control Block (PCB).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, the various values in PCB are initialized such as:  \n",
    "   a. Process identification part is filled with PID assigned to it in step 1 and also its parent‘s PID.  \n",
    "   b. The processor register values are mostly filled with zeroes, except for the stack pointer and program counter. Stack pointer is filled with the address of stack allocated to it in step 2 and program counter is filled with the address of its program entry point.  \n",
    "   c. The process state information would be set to \"New\".  \n",
    "   d. Priority would be lowest by default, but user can specify any priority during creation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, process is not allocated to any I/O devices or files. The user has to request them or if this is a child process it may inherit some resources from its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then, the operating system will link this process to scheduling queue and the process state would be changed from \"New\" to \"Ready\". Now, process is competing for the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additionally, operating system will create some other date structures such as log files or accounting files to keep track of processes activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is called the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children. Both the parent and child processes have the same memory image, open files and environment strings. However, they have distinct address spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "Process termination occurs when the exit system is called. A process usually exits after its completion but sometimes there are cases where the process aborts execution and terminates. When a process exits, resources, memory, and I/O devices are all deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some of the causes of process termination are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a parent process is terminated, its child process is also terminated. This happens when a child process cannot exist without its parent process.  \n",
    "- If a process needs additional memory more than what the system allocated, termination happens because of memory scarcity.  \n",
    "- A process tries to access a resource that is not allowed to use.  \n",
    "- If the process fails to allocate a resource within the allotted time.  \n",
    "- When a parent process requests the termination of its child process.  \n",
    "- The task is no longer required or needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 4: Process Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a path of execution within a process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control. Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers and web server. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors. The following shows the working of a single-threaded and a multithreaded process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. Microsoft Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process the inputs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread versus Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result, threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like processes, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table 3.1 – Differences between Thread and Process\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Process** | **Thread** |\n",
    "|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| Process is heavy weight or resource intensive. | Thread is light weight, taking lesser resources than a process. |\n",
    "| Process switching needs interaction with operating system. | Thread switching does not need to interact with operating system. |\n",
    "| In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has its own memory and file resources. | All threads can share same set of open files, child processes. |\n",
    "| If one process is blocked, then no other processes can execute until the first process is unblocked. | While one thread is blocked and waiting, a second thread in the same task can run. |\n",
    "| Multiple processes without using threads use more resources. | Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources. |\n",
    "| In multiple processes, each process operates independently of the others. | One thread can read, write or change another thread‘s data. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Thread over Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Responsiveness** – If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its output can be immediately returned.\n",
    "2. **Faster context switch** – Context switch time between threads is lower compared to process context switch. Process context switching requires more overhead from the CPU.\n",
    "3. **Effective utilization of multiprocessor system** – If we have multiple threads in a single process, then we can schedule threads on multiple processors. This will make process execution faster.\n",
    "4. **Resource sharing** – Resources like code, data, and files can be shared among all threads within a process.  \n",
    "   *(Note: Stack and registers can’t be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers.)*\n",
    "5. **Communication** – Communication between multiple threads is easier, as the thread shares common address space. While in process we have to follow some specific communication technique for communication between two processes.\n",
    "6. **Enhanced throughput of the system** – If a process is divided into multiple threads, and each thread function is considered as one job, then the number of jobs completed per unit of time is increased, thus increasing the throughput of the system.\n",

    "# Lesson 5: Process Schedulers\n",
    "\n",
    "Process scheduling is an activity of the process manager that controls and manages the removing of processes and choosing another process using a certain strategy in the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s put it in this way: it’s like a student attending subjects in a single room. When the time allotted for a certain subject ends, another professor comes in, teaching a different subject, depending on the schedule assigned by the school. It can also be compared to a queue in a grocery store. The same goes for the scheduling of processes. If a process is finished, another one will take its place, or simply be removed from the queue, depending on the chosen strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Scheduling Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "The operating system maintains all PCBs (Process Control Blocks) in scheduling queues. PCB is a structure of data which contains the information related to the process. The system maintains a different queue for each of the process states, and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system maintains three important scheduling queues for processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Queue** – This keeps all the processes in the system.\n",
    "- **Ready Queue** – This keeps all processes waiting in the main memory, ready and waiting to be executed. A new process is always put in this queue.\n",
    "- **Device Queue** – The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device make up this queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be compared to baking batches of cookies. Let’s say that you only have two trays and a single oven. When you have prepared two full trays of cookies, and if you’re going to make another batch, you have to put it somewhere else first, for example, on a plate (**Job Queue**), because the trays (**Ready Queue**) are still unavailable. Meanwhile, a tray of unbaked cookies must be set aside first while another tray is still being baked inside the oven (**CPU**) since one cannot bake more than one tray, which then stays on the ready queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operating system can use various strategies or policies to manage each queue (such as **First Come First Serve**, **Shortest Job First**, etc. — which will be discussed in the next part of this module). The scheduler determines how to move processes between ready and run queues, which can only have one entry per processor core on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schedulers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of schedulers that choose the jobs to be submitted to the system to decide which process is to be run. These are the **long-term**, **short-term**, and **medium-term** schedulers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible for determining which programs should be admitted to the system. It selects processes from the queue and puts them in the memory for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main task is to improve system performance while following a certain set of criteria. It is where the change happens from the **ready state** to the **running state** of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also known as **dispatchers**, because they manage processes that are ready to execute and allocate CPU to one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium-term Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the **swapping** part of the process occurs. Swapping takes place whenever a process becomes **suspended**. When processes are suspended, they cannot be completed anymore. Thus, the OS removes them from the memory and places them in secondary storage. This reduces the degree of **multiprogramming** and is necessary to improve the process mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, if a person in a line for payment forgets his/her money, he is forced to leave the queue and come at the back again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson 6: Process Scheduling Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Process scheduling is the process manager’s ability to remove a running process from the CPU and select another process based on a particular strategy. It is the cycle through which the CPU determines which processes are ready to be moved to the running state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of process scheduling is to keep the CPU occupied all the time while minimizing the response time for every program. To achieve this, the scheduler must apply the appropriate rules to swap processes in and out of the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two categories of process scheduling: **non-preemptive scheduling** and **preemptive scheduling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-preemptive Scheduling**: In this type, a process will not be interrupted and will execute until it is finished. The scheduler will not switch to another process until the current one is complete.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Preemptive Scheduling**: Here, a process can be interrupted to give way to another process with a higher priority or a shorter job than the currently running process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process scheduling is also done to ensure that work or processes are completed on time. Below are the key time concepts with respect to a process:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Process Scheduling Times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrival Time (AT)**: The time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Completion Time (CT)**: The time at which the process completes its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Burst Time (BT)**: The time required by a process for CPU execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time (TaT)**: The time difference between the completion time and the arrival time.\n",
    "  - Formula: **Turnaround Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Waiting Time (WT)**: The time difference between the turnaround time and the burst time.\n",
