    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When we power on a computer, it undergoes a process called **booting** â€” an automatic operation that checks hardware, loads necessary files, and prepares the system to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Booting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cold Booting**  \n",
    "   - Turning on the computer from a completely powered-off state.\n",
    "2. **Warm Booting**  \n",
    "   - Restarting the computer while it is already on (e.g., via the reset button or Ctrl + Alt + Del).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bootloader\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **bootloader** (or **bootstrap loader**) is a special program that:\n",
    "  - Loads system software into memory at startup.\n",
    "  - Is launched by a **bootable medium** (e.g., hard drive, USB, CD/DVD).\n",
    "  - Works with the **firmware** (like BIOS) to locate and load the OS.\n",
    "- Once the bootloader is loaded, it hands over control to the **operating system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boot Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The **boot sequence** (or **boot order**) defines the order in which the BIOS checks devices to find the OS to boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in the Boot Sequence:\n",
    "1. **Power-On Self-Test (POST)**  \n",
    "   - The system runs diagnostic checks on hardware.\n",
    "   - Issues are indicated via:\n",
    "     - **Beep codes**\n",
    "     - **POST codes**\n",
    "     - **On-screen messages**\n",

    "   - BIOS/UEFI starts and follows the boot order to find a bootable device.\n",
    "3. **Loading Bootloader**  \n",
    "   - If a suitable device is found, the bootloader is loaded from that device.\n",
    "4. **OS Loads into Memory**  \n",
    "   - The OS takes over and starts the user environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Lesson 3: Traps and Interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traps** and **interrupts** are events that **break the normal execution** of instructions by the CPU. These events cause the processor to temporarily stop what it's doing and respond to something more urgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traps (Software Interrupts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traps (also called **faults** or **exceptions**) are **synchronous interrupts** that occur due to **errors** or **abnormal conditions** detected **during program execution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Sensed by the CPU** due to internal issues.\n",
    "- Caused by **program actions**.\n",
    "- Switches the OS from **user mode to kernel mode**.\n",
    "- Handled by a **trap handler**.\n",
    "- Typically **fatal in kernel mode** and **recoverable in user mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Causes of Traps:\n",
    "- Invalid memory access\n",
    "- Division by zero\n",
    "- Undefined or illegal instruction execution\n",
    "- Accessing non-existing devices\n",
    "- Accessing restricted memory\n",
    "- Breakpoints (for debugging)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Traps behave like an automatic procedure call due to an unexpected situation in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interrupts (Hardware Interrupts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interrupts are **asynchronous events** generated by **external hardware devices** to request CPU attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- Keyboard key press\n",
    "- Mouse click or movement\n",
    "- Disk input/output completion\n",
    "- Incoming network packet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types:\n",
    "- **Hardware Interrupts**: Triggered by hardware devices.\n",
    "- **Software Interrupts**: Triggered by programs needing I/O (also referred to as traps).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trap vs Interrupt: Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature             | Trap                            | Interrupt                        |\n",

    "| Execution Timing    | Occurs during instruction cycle  | Occurs independently             |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the CPU Handles Traps and Interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interrupt occurs** (trap or hardware).\n",
    "2. CPU **saves the current state** (registers, memory location, etc.).\n",
    "3. Transfers control to an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** or **Trap Handler**.\n",
    "4. ISR **executes necessary actions**.\n",
    "5. CPU **restores saved state**.\n",
    "6. Original process **resumes execution** as if nothing happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Analogy: Pausing a movie (program) to respond to your momâ€™s request (interrupt). Once you finish the errand, you come back and resume the movie from where you paused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interrupt Disabling\n",
    "\n",
    "To **avoid overlapping or nested interrupts**, the system disables further interrupts while one is being serviced. Once the current interrupt task is complete, interrupts are re-enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures:\n",
    "- **System stability**\n",
    "- **Proper sequencing** of interrupt handling\n",
    "- **No data loss** due to interrupt interference\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traps** = software-based, triggered by internal errors.\n",
    "- **Interrupts** = hardware-based, triggered by devices needing CPU attention.\n",
    "- CPU handles both by **pausing the current task**, **servicing the interrupt**, and **resuming** the original task afterward.\n",
    "- **Interrupt disabling** ensures clean and organized handling of interrupt routines.\n",

    "# Lesson 4: I/O Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing input and output (I/O) devices is a **critical function** of the operating system (OS). These devices vary widely in **functionality and performance**, requiring different methods for control and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage this complexity, the OS uses an **I/O subsystem** within its kernel. This subsystem helps **isolate** the rest of the kernel from the intricate details of handling hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Device Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Device drivers** are software components that allow the OS to communicate with specific hardware devices such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keyboards\n",
    "- Printers\n",
    "- Scanners\n",
    "- Digital cameras\n",
    "- External storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responsibilities of a Device Driver:\n",
    "- Accept and manage requests from device-independent software.\n",
    "- Perform error handling and I/O communication with the device controller.\n",
    "- Ensure that processes complete successfully and requests are executed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Devices Connect:\n",
    "- **Ports**: Connection points between devices and computers.\n",
    "- **Bus**: A group of wires used to transfer data, following a **defined protocol** for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I/O Operation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Device driver** loads registers in the **device controller**.\n",
    "2. **Device controller** interprets the registers to determine the required task.\n",
    "3. Data is transferred from the device to the **local buffer**.\n",
    "4. Once the task is complete, the device controller sends an **interrupt signal** to the device driver.\n",
    "5. The device driver then **returns control** to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods of I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Synchronous I/O\n",
    "- The **CPU waits** for the I/O operation to finish before continuing its process.\n",
    "- Slower due to idle CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Asynchronous I/O\n",
    "- **I/O occurs concurrently** with CPU processing.\n",
    "- Increases overall system efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polling** is the process where the CPU **repeatedly checks** the status of an I/O device to see if it needs attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- Also known as **polled I/O** or **software-driven I/O**.\n",
    "- Simple and synchronous.\n",
    "- The processor actively requests device status.\n",
    "- The I/O device places data into a **status register**, and the CPU must **fetch it manually**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantage:\n",
    "- **Inefficient**, as the CPU wastes time constantly checking devices that may not need service.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Dual-Mode Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of hardware protection is **dual-mode operation**, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitor Mode (System/Kernel Mode)**: \n",
    "  - Full access to CPU instructions and memory.\n",

    "  - Only the OS (in monitor mode) can modify the timer or disable interrupts (privileged operations).\n",
    "  - The **scheduler** initializes the timer before giving CPU control to user processes.\n",
    "  - When the timer expires, a **timer interrupt** triggers the OS to evaluate whether the running process should continue.\n",

    "### 2. Memory Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prevents processes from accessing unauthorized memory areas.\n",
    "- **How**:\n",
    "  - Memory is divided into segments using:\n",
    "    - **Base Register**: Defines the start of accessible memory.\n",
    "    - **Limit Register**: Defines the range (length) of accessible memory.\n",
    "  - These registers can only be modified through **privileged instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. I/O Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prevents user programs from directly accessing I/O devices.\n",
    "- **How**:\n",
    "  - All **I/O instructions are privileged**.\n",
    "  - User code must request I/O access via **system calls**.\n",
    "  - The OS (in monitor mode) validates and performs the I/O operations.\n",
