    "\n",
    "### Direct Proof  \n",
    "A method of proving a statement by straightforward logical reasoning.  \n",
    "You start from known facts or assumptions (like axioms or previously proven theorems) and use logical steps to arrive at the statement you're trying to prove.  \n",
    "**Example**: If n is even, then n² is even.  \n",
    "**Proof**: Let n=2k for some integer n, then n²=(2k)²=4k²=2(2k²) which is even.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof by Induction  \n",
    "A method used to prove statements that are asserted for all natural numbers (or integers in general). It involves two main steps:  \n",
    "- **Base Case**: Prove the statement is true for the first value (usually n=0 or n=1).  \n",
    "- **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some n=k, then prove it is also true for n=k+1.  \n",
    "If both steps are successful, the statement is true for all natural numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof by Contradiction  \n",
    "Assumes that the statement you want to prove is false, and then shows that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction. Therefore, the statement must be true.  \n",
    "**Example**: Prove 2 is irrational  \n",
    "**Proof**: Assume the opposite (that it’s rational), then derive a contradiction in the form of a common factor or logical inconsistency.  \n",
