    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its execution.\n",
    "- The best, worst, and average-case complexities of a given algorithm are numerical functions of the size of the instances.\n",
    "- It is difficult to work with these functions exactly because they are often very complicated, with many little up and down bumps. Thus, it is usually cleaner and easier to talk about upper and lower bounds of such functions.\n",
    "- This is where the Big O notation comes into the picture.\n",
