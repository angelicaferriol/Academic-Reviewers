    "## RELATIONAL DATABASE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation** – A table used to represent data and their relationships in the relational model.  \n",
    "**Attribute** – A property that defines an entity and corresponds to a column in a table.  \n",
    "**Tuple** – A row in a relation that contains a set of related data values representing a real-world entity or relationship.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of a Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is stored in rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).  \n",
    "- Each column (attribute) has a unique name and atomic values.  \n",
    "- Each row (tuple) represents a unique record; no duplicate rows.  \n",
    "- Row and column order does not matter.  \n",
    "- Each attribute has a defined domain (valid data types).  \n",
    "- `NULL` values can represent missing data.  \n",
    "- Has a **relation schema** defining its name and attributes.  \n",
    "- Typically includes a **primary key** to uniquely identify records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CLASSIFICATION OF ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "\n",
    "### Based on Their Role as Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Super Key** – Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.  \n",
    "- **Candidate Key** – A minimal super key.  \n",
    "- **Primary Key** – The chosen candidate key.  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key** – Refers to a primary key in another table.  \n",
    "- **Alternate Key** – Candidate key not chosen as primary.  \n",
    "- **Composite Key** – A primary key consisting of multiple attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Based on Data Type and Constraints (Domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valid data types: numeric, character, boolean, date, time.  \n",
    "- Domain constraints ensure consistent and correct data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Based on Function in Relationships (Referential Integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes maintain consistency between related data.  \n",
    "- Foreign key in one table refers to a primary key in another.  \n",
    "- Prevents orphaned records, enforces consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## DATABASE NORMALIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**  \n",
    "The process of organizing attributes in a database to reduce or eliminate data redundancy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**  \n",
    "Refines the initial data model to ensure unambiguous, intended results.  \n",
    "Often involves splitting tables and linking them for meaningful queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHY NORMALIZE?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization eliminates anomalies and improves data integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion Anomalies** – Cannot insert data without additional unnecessary data.  \n",
    "- **Deletion Anomalies** – Loss of data due to deletion of related data.  \n",
    "- **Update Anomalies** – Inconsistent data after partial updates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## TERMINOLOGIES\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Database Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Redundancy** – Repetition of data across the database.  \n",
    "- **Anomalies** – Issues in insert, update, or delete operations.  \n",
    "- **Functional Dependency** – One attribute’s value determines another (e.g., ISBN → Title).  \n",
    "- **Determinant** – Attribute(s) that determine another.  \n",
    "- **Partial Dependency** – Non-key attribute depends on part of a composite key.  \n",
    "- **Full Dependency** – Depends on the entire composite key.  \n",
    "- **Transitive Dependency** – A → B and B → C implies A → C.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization & Normal Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unnormalized Form (UNF)** – Contains repeating groups.  \n",
    "- **First Normal Form (1NF)** – No repeating groups; single-valued attributes.  \n",
    "- **Second Normal Form (2NF)** – 1NF + no partial dependencies.  \n",
    "- **Third Normal Form (3NF)** – 2NF + no transitive dependencies.  \n",
    "- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** – Every determinant is a super key.  \n",
    "- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** – BCNF + no multivalued dependencies.  \n",
    "- **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)** – 4NF + no unnecessary decompositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decomposition** – Splitting a table into smaller ones.  \n",
    "- **Dependency Preserving** – Keeps original functional dependencies intact.  \n",
    "- **Lossless Decomposition** – Allows full reconstruction of original data without errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNF → 1NF\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove repeating groups.  \n",
    "- Ensure single values at each row-column intersection.  \n",
    "- Move repeating data to new table with a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1NF → 2NF\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminate partial dependencies.  \n",
    "- Move partial dependencies to new table.  \n",
    "- Ensure all attributes fully depend on the entire primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2NF → 3NF\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminate transitive dependencies.  \n",
    "- Move transitively dependent attributes to a new table with their determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond 3NF\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BCNF** – All determinants must be super keys.  \n",
    "- **4NF & 5NF** – Eliminate multivalued and join dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization** improves integrity and reduces redundancy but increases table count and complexity of queries.  \n",
    "- **Denormalization** may be used to improve performance in some systems by reintroducing controlled redundancy.\n"
