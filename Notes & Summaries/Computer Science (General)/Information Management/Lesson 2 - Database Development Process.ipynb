    "- **Enterprise Modelling:**  \n",
    "  - Stakeholders define data needs and system scope.  \n",
    "  - Data administrator ensures legal and ethical compliance.  \n",
    "  - Outputs a data requirements document listing data items, attributes, and constraints.  \n",
    "  - Examines current system, organizational needs, and external factors.  \n",
    "  - Defines systems goals, data-sharing needs, and system integration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conceptual Data Modelling**  \n",
    "  - Helps stakeholders understand the structure of the business data and how different entities relate to each other.  \n",
    "  - Serves as a foundation for logical and physical data modelling which involve more specific details about data types, formats, and database implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conceptual Data Modelling**  \n",
    "  - Data analysis results in a conceptual data model defining data structure and constraints.  \n",
    "  - Model focuses on what data is needed, not how it will be processed.  \n",
    "  - Acts as a shared reference for clients and developers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### DESIGN\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical Database Design**  \n",
    "  - Converts conceptual model into a logical schema (e.g., relational, object-oriented)  \n",
    "  - Defines tables, constraints, and storage methods.  \n",
    "  - Design is iterative, refining structure for efficiency and usability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Database Design and Definition**  \n",
    "  - Includes conceptual, logical, and physical design stages.  \n",
    "  - Define database to DBMS (often generated from repository)  \n",
    "  - Often implemented using SQL DDL statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPLEMENTATION\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Implementation**  \n",
    "  - Code and test database processing programs.  \n",
    "  - Builds the database using the logical schema.  \n",
    "  - Populates data via imports, application programs, or bulk loads.  \n",
    "  - Configures security, permissions, and tablespaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### MAINTENANCE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Maintenance**  \n",
    "  - Analyze database and database applications to ensure that evolving information requirements are met.  \n",
    "  - Adapts to changes, bug fixes, and system updates.  \n",
    "  - Tasks include access management, backups, recovery, security, and hardware maintenance.  \n",

    "## CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL (CDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represents a high-level, business-oriented view of the system.  \n",
    "- Focuses on what data is needed rather than how it is structured or stored.  \n",
    "- Identifies key entities and their relationships, such as how a CRM system interacts with marketing, sales, and support teams.  \n",
    "- Includes entities like customers, marketing channels, and sales transactions to show how data flows across different parts of the business.  \n",
    "- Uses arrows and diagrams to visualize connections, ensuring all relevant stakeholders understand how data interacts within the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LOGICAL DATA MODEL (LDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Builds upon the conceptual model by specifying data structure, types, and relationships.  \n",
    "- Defines the specific attributes each entity needs, such as a customer entity having fields like Name, Email, Address, and Purchase History.  \n",
    "- Identifies how data flows between systems, such as a CRM retrieving customer transaction details from a sales database.  \n",
    "- Helps teams ensure that the data supports business needs while maintaining consistency and accuracy.  \n",
    "- Uses diagrams and relationships to show data dependencies, helping developers and analysts plan how the system will function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## PHYSICAL DATA MODEL (PDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts the logical model into an actual database structure that can be implemented.  \n",
    "- Defines tables, rows, columns, and storage formats within the database.  \n",
    "- Establishes primary keys (e.g., Customer ID) to uniquely identify records and foreign keys to link data across tables.  \n",
    "- Specifies database constraints, indexes, and relationships to optimize data retrieval and integrity.  \n",
    "- Acts as a blueprint for database developers to create the system or customize an existing solution.  \n",
