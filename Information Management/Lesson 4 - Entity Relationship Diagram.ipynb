    "## ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM\n",
    "\n",
    "An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of how entities (people, objects, or concepts) relate within a system. Used primarily in database design, ERDs use symbols like rectangles (entities), diamonds (relationships), and ovals (attributes). Developed by Peter Chen in the 1970s, ERDs help structure relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY COMPONENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity** - a thing with stored data (e.g., Customer, Product). Represented as rectangles.  \n",
    "  - **Strong Entity** - defined by its own attributes.  \n",
    "  - **Weak Entity** - depends on another entity.  \n",
    "  - **Associative Entity** - links two entities.  \n",
    "  - **Entity Type** - a group of entities sharing common properties (e.g., Students, Cars).  \n",
    "  - **Entity Instance** - a specific example of an entity type (e.g., “John Doe” as an instance of “Employee”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relationship** - describes how entities interact (e.g., “Student enrolls in Course”). Represented as diamonds or labeled lines.  \n",
    "  - **Relationship Type** - A general association (e.g., “Completes” between Employee and Course).  \n",
    "  - **Relationship Instance** - A specific occurrence of a relationship (e.g., “John Doe completes introduction to Databases”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute** - A property of an entity (e.g., Student_ID, Name). Represented as ovals.  \n",
    "  - Types: Simple, Composite, Derived, Single-valued, Multivalue.  \n",
    "  - Attributes can also serve as keys (Primary, Candidate, Foreign).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## TYPES OF ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required vs. Optional Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Required Attribute**: Must have a value for every entity (e.g., medical condition in an insurance application).  \n",
    "- **Optional Attribute**: May be left blank (e.g., provincial address in an insurance application).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple vs. Composite Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Attribute**: Cannot be broken down further (e.g., Age, Employee ID).  \n",
    "- **Composite Attribute**: Can be split into meaningful parts (e.g., Name → First Name, Last Name; Address → Street, City, Zip Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-Valued vs. Multivalued Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Valued**: Holds only one value per entity (e.g., Birthdate).  \n",
    "- **Multivalued**: Can store multiple values (e.g., Phone Numbers, Skills). Represented by double ovals in ERDs. When converting to a relational model, a separate relation is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stored vs. Derived Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stored Attribute**: Directly entered and saved in the database (e.g., Name).  \n",
    "- **Derived Attribute**: Computed from another attribute (e.g., Age derived from Birthdate). Often shown with dotted ovals in ERDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers (Keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifier**: Uniquely distinguishes each entity instance (e.g., Student Roll Number).  \n",
    "  - Must not change, be null, or repeat.  \n",
    "  - **Primary Key**: The chosen unique identifier in a relation.  \n",
    "  - **Candidate Key**: Any attribute(s) that could serve as a primary key.  \n",
    "  - **Composite Key**: A primary key with multiple attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERISTICS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree of Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of relationship refers to the number of entity types involved in a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Relationship Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unary (Degree 1)** - a relationship where the same entity is involved.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: A ‘Student’ can be a ‘Monitor’ of another ‘Student’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary (Degree 2)** - a relationship between two different entity types. (Most common and easiest to convert into tables.)  \n",
    "  - *Ex. 1*: A ‘Student’ has an ‘ID’.  \n",
    "  - *Ex. 2*: A ‘Father’ has multiple ‘Daughters’, but each ‘Daughter’ has only one ‘Father’ (one-to-many).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ternary (Degree 3)** - a relationship involving three different entity types.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: A ‘Teacher’ teaches a ‘Course’ in a ‘Class’.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-ary (Degree n)** - a relationship with n entities. (Rare due to complexity in conversion).  \n",
    "  - *Example*: A relationship involving ‘Teacher’, ‘Class’, ‘Location’, ‘Salary’, and ‘Course’ (Degree = 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Unary and binary relationships are widely used due to their simplicity. Higher-degree relationships are complex and should be used only when necessary for modeling sophisticated interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CARDINALITY OF RELATIONSHIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifies the number of instances of an entity type that can be associated with the instances of another entity type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-to-One (1:1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each entity in A is linked to at most one entity in B, and vice versa.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: A hospital department has one head. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One-to-Many (1:M)\n",
    "\n",
    "- An entity in A is linked to multiple entities in B, but each entity in B is linked to at most one entity in A.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: A hospital department has multiple doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many-to-One (M:1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reverse of one-to-many; multiple entities in A are linked to a single entity in B.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: Multiple surgeries are performed by one surgeon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many-to-Many (M:M)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entities in A and B can each have multiple associations with each other.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: Employees work on multiple projects. (Often resolved using an intermediary table).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CARDINALITY CONSTRAINTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum Cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "- The highest number of times an instance in one entity can relate to instances of another entity (zero or one).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Cardinality (Ordinality)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The lowest number of times an instance in one entity must be associated with an instance in the related entity (one or many).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardinality and ordinality are shown by the styling of a line and its endpoints, according to the chosen notation style.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## STRONG VS. WEAK ENTITY\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exists independently and is not dependent on any other entity.  \n",
    "- Always has a primary key.  \n",
    "- Represented by a single rectangle in an ER diagram.  \n",
    "- Forms a strong entity set when grouped with other strong entities.  \n",
    "- Relationships between strong entities are shown with a single diamond.  \n",
    "- Can have total or partial participation in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weak Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depends on a strong entity for existence.  \n",
    "- Lacks a primary key and instead has a partial discriminator key.  \n",
    "- Represented by a double rectangle in an ER diagram.  \n",
    "- The relationship with a strong entity is shown using a double diamond (identifying relationship).  \n",
    "- Always has total participation in its identifying relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASSOCIATIVE ENTITIES\n",
    "\n",
    "- An associative entity (also called a junction table or bridge table) represents many-to-many relationships in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). It simplifies these relationships by breaking them into two one-to-many relationships and helps ensure normalization and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weak Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "- A many-to-many relationship exists  \n",
    "- Identified by a “crow’s foot” on both ends of a relationship (e.g., Students and Courses).  \n",
    "- An intermediate entity is needed  \n",
    "  - Like Enrollments linking Students and Courses.  \n",
    "- Foreign keys are required.  \n",
    "  - The entity includes foreign keys from the related entities (StudentID, CourseID).  \n",
    "- Database normalization is improved.  \n",
    "  - Reduces redundancy and simplifies relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- E-commerce: Customer ↔ Orders ↔ Products (Orders link customers and products).  \n",
    "- Library: Books ↔ Borrowings ↔ Members (Borrowings track book loans).  \n",
    "- University: Students ↔ Enrollments ↔ Courses (Enrollments track course participation).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using clear names (e.g., Orders, Borrowings) and ensuring each relationship instance is unique with composite primary keys, you create efficient and maintainable databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONVERSION OF ER DIAGRAM TO RELATION\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map regular entities** - Each regular entity in an ERD is transformed into a relation.  \n",
    "  - The name of the relation is generally the same as the entity type.  \n",
    "  - Each simple attribute of the entity type becomes an attribute of the relation.  \n",
    "  - The identifier of the entity type becomes the primary key of the relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Composite attributes** – When a regular entity type has a composite attribute, only the simple components of the composite attribute are included in the new relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multivalued attributes** – When a regular entity type contains a multivalued attribute, two new relations are created.  \n",
    "  - The first relation contains all of the attributes of the entity type except the multivalued attributes.  \n",
    "  - The second relation contains two attributes that form the primary key of the second relation.  \n",
    "    - The first of these attributes is the primary key from the first relation.  \n",
    "    - The second is the multivalued attribute.  \n",
    "  - The name of the second relation should capture the meaning of the multivalued attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map weak entity types**  \n",
    "  - For each weak entity type, create a new relation and include all of the simple attributes as attributes of this relation.  \n",
    "  - They include the primary key of the identifying relation as a foreign key attribute of this new relation.  \n",
    "  - The primary key of the new relation is the combination of the primary key of the identifying relation and the partial identifier of the weak entity type.  \n",
    "  - In practice, an alternative approach is often used to simplify the primary key of the Dependent relation.  \n",
    "    - Create a new attribute called `Dependent_no` which will be used as a surrogate primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map binary relationships**  \n",
    "  - The procedure for representing relationships depends on both the degree of the relationships and the cardinalities of the relationships.  \n",
    "  - The procedure is given below for mapping binary one-to-many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map binary one-to-many relationships**  \n",
    "  - For each binary 1:M relationship, first create a relation for each of the 2 entity types participating in the relationship (step 1 procedure).  \n",
    "  - Next include the PK (primary key) attribute (or attributes) of the entity on the one side of the relationship as an FK (foreign key) in the relation that is on the many-side of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map associative entities**  \n",
    "  - When a data modeler encounters a many-to-many relationship, that relationship may be modeled as an associative entity in the ERD.  \n",
    "  - The first step is to create 3 relations, one for each of the 2 participating entity types and the third for the associative entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map unary relationships**  \n",
    "  - Unary relationships are also called recursive relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SURROGATE KEYS\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial, system-generated key used to uniquely identify each entity in a dimension table, independent of its natural key. It has no business meaning and is typically an incrementing integer, a timestamp, or a random alphanumeric string. Surrogate keys are essential for linking dimension tables to fact tables and are managed by the data warehouse team during data transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Surrogate Keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Natural Keys**  \n",
    "  - Different OLTP systems may use conflicting or non-unique keys, making consolidation difficult.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing Attributes**  \n",
    "  - Natural keys may change or be reused, affecting historical data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Performance**  \n",
    "  - Integer surrogate keys reduce table size and improve query speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Exceptions & Realignments**  \n",
    "  - Useful for managing changes in measures or data summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose a Surrogate Key\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural keys are inconsistent, change over time, or cause confusion.  \n",
    "- A system-generated key ensures uniqueness and scalability.  \n",
    "- Avoids reliance on business-specific values that may become obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use surrogate keys as primary keys while keeping natural keys as foreign keys.  \n",
    "- Avoid GUIDs as surrogate keys in data warehouses due to their large size (16 bytes vs. 4 bytes for integers), which impacts indexing performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While natural keys work in simpler setups, surrogate keys enhance flexibility, performance, and long-term maintainability in data warehousing.\n"
