    "## DATA VS. INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** – raw or unprocessed facts.  \n",
    "**Information** – when data is processed, organized, interpreted, and structured.\n",

    "## COMPONENTS OF DATABASE ENVIRONMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware** – refers to the physical, electronic devices such as computers and hard disks that offer the interface between computers and real-world systems.  \n",
    "- **Software** – software that controls a database, including the database software, operating system, network tools, and applications for data access.  \n",
    "- **Data** – facts and information that need to be organized and processed to make it more meaningful.  \n",
    "- **Procedures** – refer to the instructions utilized in a database management system, which include instructions for installation and setup, login and logout, daily operations management, data backups, and report generation.  \n",
    "- **Database Access Language** – language used to write commands to access, update, and delete data stored in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ADDITIONALS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CASE Tools** – computer-aided software engineering  \n",
    "- **Repository** – a centralized storehouse of metadata.  \n",
    "- **Database Management System (DBMS)** – software for managing the database.  \n",
    "- **Database** – storehouse of the data  \n",
    "- **Application Programs** – software using the data  \n",
    "- **User Interface** – text and graphical displays to users  \n",
    "- **Data Administrators** – personnel responsible for maintaining the database.  \n",
    "- **System Developers** – personnel responsible for designing databases and software.  \n",
    "- **End Users** – people who use the applications and databases\n",

    "## METADATA\n",
    "\n",
    "Information that describes the structure, content, and context of a database. It's also known as \"data about data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Metadata**  \n",
    "Metadata contains information about a data asset such as:  \n",
    "- Properties  \n",
    "- Origin  \n",
    "- History  \n",
    "- Location  \n",
    "- Creation date  \n",

    "## TRADITIONAL FILE PROCESSING\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional file processing is a system where data is stored for each application within an organization. In this approach:  \n",
    "- Each department typically has its own set of files, which leads to data redundancy and data isolation.  \n",
    "- There is no overall plan or model to guide application growth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some disadvantages of traditional file processing are:**  \n",
    "- **Duplication of Data** – This leads to inefficient use of storage space and potential compromises to data integrity. Databases centralize storage for consistency.  \n",
    "- **Interdependence** – Data and programs are tightly linked, unlike databases that separate them.  \n",
    "- **Limited Data Sharing** – File systems struggle with data sharing and report generation, while databases streamline both.  \n",
    "- **Security & Integrity** – Databases enforce better security and data consistency constraints.  \n",
    "- **Efficiency & Maintenance** – File systems are harder to maintain, while databases optimize storage and updates.  \n",
    "- **Concurrency & Atomicity** – Databases handle simultaneous access and transactions better.  \n",
    "- **Failure & Cost** – File system failures are isolated, while database failures impact multiple applications. However, file systems are cheaper in hardware costs.\n",

    "## THE DATABASE APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach where data are logically stored in databases, managed by a DBMS.  \n",
    "A database is designed using data models which define the nature and relationships among data.  \n",
    "The effectiveness and efficiency of a database are directly associated with the structure of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of the Database Approach**  \n",
    "- Planned data redundancy  \n",
    "- Minimal data duplication  \n",
    "- Improved data consistency  \n",
    "- Program data independence  \n",
    "- Allows data to evolve without changing the application programs  \n",
    "- Reduced program maintenance  \n",
    "- Improved data sharing  \n",
    "- Increased productivity of application development  \n",
    "- Enforcement of standards  \n",
    "- Improved data quality  \n",
    "- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness  \n",
    "- Improved decision support  \n",

    "## RANGE OF DATABASE APPLICATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personal Databases** – supports one user  \n",
    "- **Workgroup Databases (less than 25 users)** – supported by two-tier client/server databases  \n",
    "- **Department/Division Databases (between 25 to 100 users)** – supported by multitier client/server databases  \n",
    "- **Enterprise Databases** – scope is an entire organization\n",

    "## EVOLUTION OF DATABASE SYSTEMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1960s** – Experimental proof of concept.  \n",
    "- **1970 - 1990** – Hierarchical, Network  \n",
    "- **1980 - Present** – Relational  \n",
    "- **1990 - Present** – Object-Oriented  \n",
    "- **1990 - Present** – Object-Relational  \n",
    "- **2000 - Present** – Not only SQL (NoSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution of Database Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1970 - 1990 - Hierarchical**  \n",
    "  Hierarchical – data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure; confined to up to ‘one to many relationships’.  \n",
    "- **1970 - 1990 - Network**  \n",
    "  Network – much like the hierarchical model except that it permitted many to many relationships.  \n",
    "- **1980 – present - Relational**  \n",
    "  Relational (RDB) – establish the relationships between entities through common fields included in a file, called a relation  \n",
    "- **1990 - present - Object-Oriented**  \n",
    "  Object-oriented (OODB) – subscribes to a model with information represented by objects; encapsulates both data and behavior  \n",
    "- **1990 - present – Object-relational**  \n",
    "  Object-relational (ORDB) – provides a middle ground between relational databases and object-oriented databases  \n",

    "---\n",

    "## OTHER CONCEPTS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Warehouse** – subject oriented, integrated, time variant, non volatile collection of data used in support of management decision making and business intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voluminous Time-Variant Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **voluminous database of time-variant data** contains large amounts of historical data.\n",
    "- This data is often **non-volatile** (i.e., it is not deleted — *‘di tinatanggal*).\n",
    "- It is **useful for time-series analysis**, allowing you to observe how things have changed over time.\n",
    "- Common use cases:\n",
    "  - Forecasting and prediction\n",
    "  - Business Intelligence (BI)\n",
    "  - Decision-making support\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Mart\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Data Mart** is a **smaller, more focused version of a Data Warehouse**.\n",
    "- It is typically organized by **specific subjects or business areas** to make data management and access easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web-Enabled Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **web-enabled database** refers to a database with a **web-based interface**.\n",
    "- It offers **standard database functionalities**, but is accessed **remotely through a browser** or web application.\n"
