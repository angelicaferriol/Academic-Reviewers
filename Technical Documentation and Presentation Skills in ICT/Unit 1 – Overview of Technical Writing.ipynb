    "## Definition of Technical Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical writing is the practice of conveying specialized information in a structured and understandable manner. It is widely used in industries such as engineering, healthcare, information technology, and finance. The primary goal of technical writing is to make complex information accessible to a targeted audience, whether they are experts, professionals, or general users. Unlike creative or literary writing, technical writing prioritizes functionality, clarity, and accuracy over artistic expression. Examples of technical writing include instruction manuals, user guides, white papers, and software documentation.\n",
